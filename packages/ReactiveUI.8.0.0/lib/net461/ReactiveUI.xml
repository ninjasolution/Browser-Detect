             <summary>
             ViewModelActivator is a helper class that you instantiate in your
             ViewModel classes in order to help with Activation. Views will internally
             call this class when the corresponding View comes on screen. This means
             you can set up resources such as subscriptions to global objects that
             should be cleaned up on exit. Once you instantiate this class, use the
             WhenActivated method to register what to do when activated.
            
             View Activation is  **not** the same as being loaded / unloaded; Views
             are Activated when they *enter* the Visual Tree, and are Deactivated when
             they *leave* the Visual Tree. This is a critical difference when it comes
             to views that are recycled, such as UITableViews or Virtualizing
             ScrollViews.
            
             Create this class solely in the **Base Class** of any classes that inherit
             from this class (i.e. if you create a FooViewModel that supports activation,
             the instance should be protected and a child BarViewModel should use the
             existing ViewModelActivator).
            
             NOTE: You **must** set up Activation in the corresponding View when using
             ViewModel Activation.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            Interactions allow collaborating components to asynchronously ask questions of each other. Typically,
            a view model wants to ask the user a question before proceeding with some operation, and it's the view
            that provides the interface via which users can answer the question.
            </para>
            <para>
            Interactions have both an input and output, both of which are strongly-typed via generic type parameters.
            The input is passed into the interaction so that handlers have the information they require. The output
            is provided by a handler.
            </para>
            <para>
            By default, handlers are invoked in reverse order of registration. That is, handlers registered later
            are given the opportunity to handle interactions before handlers that were registered earlier. This
            chaining mechanism enables handlers to be registered temporarily in a specific context, such that
            interactions can be handled in a different manner. Subclasses may modify this behavior by overriding
            the <see cref="M:ReactiveUI.Interaction`2.Handle(`0)"/> method.
            </para>
            <para>
            Note that handlers are not required to handle an interaction. They can choose to ignore it, leaving it
            for some other handler to handle. If no handler handles the interaction, the <see cref="M:ReactiveUI.Interaction`2.Handle(`0)"/> method
            will throw an <see cref="T:ReactiveUI.UnhandledInteractionException`2"/>.

            Reactive commands encapsulate the behavior of running some execution logic and then surfacing the results on the UI

            execution logic. Optionally, you can provide an observable that governs the availability of the command for execution,
            as well as a scheduler to which events will be delivered.
            </para>
            <para>
            The <see cref="P:ReactiveUI.ReactiveCommand.CanExecute"/> property provides an observable that can be used to determine whether the command is
            eligible for execution. The value of this observable is determined by both the <c>canExecute</c> observable provided
            during command creation, and the current execution status of the command. A command that is already executing will
            yield <c>false</c> from its <see cref="P:ReactiveUI.ReactiveCommand.CanExecute"/> observable regardless of the <c>canExecute</c> observable provided
            during command creation.
            </para>
            <para>
            The <see cref="P:ReactiveUI.ReactiveCommand.IsExecuting"/> property provides an observable whose value indicates whether the command is currently
            executing. This can be a useful means of triggering UI, such as displaying an activity indicator whilst a command is
            executing.

            As discussed above, you are under no obligation to somehow incorporate this into your <c>canExecute</c> observable
            because that is taken care of for you. That is, if the value of <c>IsExecuting</c> is <c>true</c>, the value of
            <c>CanExecute</c> will be <c>false</c>. However, if the value of <c>CanExecute</c> is <c>false</c>, that does not imply
            the value of <c>IsExecuting</c> is <c>true</c>.
            </para>
            <para>
            Any errors in your command's execution logic (including any <c>canExecute</c> observable you choose to provide) will be
            surfaced via the <see cref="P:ReactiveUI.ReactiveCommand.ThrownExceptions"/> observable. This gives you the opportunity to handle the error before
            it triggers a default handler that tears down the application. For example, you might use this as a means of alerting
            the user that something has gone wrong executing the command.
            </para>
            <para>
            For the sake of convenience, all <c>ReactiveCommand</c> instances are also implementations of <see cref="T:System.Windows.Input.ICommand"/>.
            This allows you to easily integrate instances of <c>ReactiveCommand</c> into platforms that understands <c>ICommand</c>

            Any exceptions that are not observed via this observable will propagate out and cause the application to be torn

            <summary>
            This scheduler attempts to deal with some of the brain-dead defaults
            on certain Microsoft platforms that make it difficult to access the
            Dispatcher during startup. This class wraps a scheduler and if it
            isn't available yet, it simply runs the scheduled item immediately.
